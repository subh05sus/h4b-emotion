# Context-Aware Emotion Detection - Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the emotion detection system to maintain context from previous analyses, making the AI responses more natural and coherent by considering past interactions.

## New Features Added

### 1. Context Tracking System
- **Emotion History**: Tracks the last 10 emotion detections with timestamps and confidence scores
- **Object History**: Maintains a record of the last 5 object detections 
- **Interaction Counting**: Keeps track of total number of analyses performed
- **Session Duration**: Monitors how long the current session has been running

### 2. Trend Analysis
- **Emotion Consistency**: Detects when emotions remain consistent across multiple analyses
- **Emotion Changes**: Identifies and describes transitions between different emotions
- **Object Consistency**: Tracks objects that appear frequently across multiple frames

### 3. Context-Aware Messaging
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Gemini now receives context from previous interactions
- **Natural Responses**: AI can reference past emotions and acknowledge patterns
- **Conversational Continuity**: Messages feel more like an ongoing conversation rather than isolated observations

### 4. New API Endpoints
- **Enhanced Health Endpoint**: `/health` now includes context information
- **Context Reset**: `/reset-context` (POST) allows clearing the analysis history

## Technical Implementation

### Global Variables Added
```python
emotion_history = []          # List of past emotion detections
object_history = []           # List of past object detections  
analysis_context = {          # Structured context data
    "previous_emotions": [],
    "emotion_trends": "",
    "object_consistency": [],
    "interaction_count": 0,
    "session_start_time": time.time()
}
```

### Key Functions Added
- `update_analysis_context()`: Updates context with new analysis data
- `get_context_summary()`: Generates human-readable context summary for Gemini
- `reset_analysis_context()`: Clears all context data for new sessions

### Enhanced Functions
- `analyze_emotion_and_objects_with_gemini()`: Now includes context in prompts
- `camera_worker()`: Calls context update function after each analysis
- `health()` endpoint: Returns context information

## Example Context-Aware Responses

**Without Context:**
- "I can see you're feeling happy! That's a nice setup you have there."

**With Context:**
- "Still looking happy! I can see you're keeping that positive energy going."
- "I notice you've shifted from neutral to more focused - that laptop is getting some serious attention!"
- "You seem to be in a good mood today - this is the third time I've seen you smiling."

## Benefits

1. **More Natural Conversations**: AI acknowledges patterns and changes rather than treating each frame in isolation
2. **Better User Experience**: Responses feel more personal and aware
3. **Useful Analytics**: Track emotion patterns over time
4. **Session Continuity**: Maintains awareness throughout the entire interaction session
5. **Debugging Capabilities**: Context reset and health endpoints help with monitoring and troubleshooting

## Usage

The context system works automatically once the application starts. No additional configuration is needed. The system:

1. Automatically tracks all emotion and object detections
2. Includes context in Gemini prompts
3. Provides context-aware responses
4. Can be monitored via the `/health` endpoint
5. Can be reset via the `/reset-context` endpoint if needed

## Testing

A test script (`test_context.py`) has been created to verify the context functionality works correctly, testing:
- Context initialization
- Emotion history tracking
- Trend detection
- Object consistency analysis
- Context summary generation
